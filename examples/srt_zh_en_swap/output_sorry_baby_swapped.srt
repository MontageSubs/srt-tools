so that we can distinguish which books are really the good books.
好书才能更显珍贵

哪怕我看不清那理由

508

And it didn't feel like fiction,

00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:30,520
which I think is a compliment in this case.
不是那种做作的虚构

- 来 进来 - 嗯

570
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,430
Oh, do you mind taking your boots off?
哦 介意把鞋脱一下吗？

571
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:03,270
Oh, yeah. duh.
哦 对 我真笨

572
00:32:03,410 --> 00:32:04,100
No.
别

573
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,200
- Sorry. - Don't be sorry.
- 抱歉 - 不用道歉

574
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,260
Do you have my thesis?
你带我的论文了吗？

575
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:12,360
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
哦 有的 有的 带了

576
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,260
Your shoes are untied.
你鞋带开了

577
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:12,440
Ooh.
唔

578
00:36:12,750 --> 00:36:15,420
Hey, I've been literally waiting with bated breath.
我等得心都痒死了

579
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:16,550
How did it go?
快说说

580
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,120
Agnes, are you okay?
安尼丝 你没事吧？

581
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,750
What happened?
发生什么事了？

582
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:31,640
I don't know.
说不上来

583
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,870
My pants are broken.
裤子被弄坏了

584
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,610
And then we started kissing.
然后我们开始接吻

585
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,730
And I thought, we're kissing.
我心想 我们竟然在接吻

586
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:58,320
I was thinking we were kissing the whole time,
我一直在想

587
00:36:58,350 --> 00:37:00,500
like in a bad way
这种接吻很糟

588
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:03,130
where you aren't having a good time,
一点也不享受

589
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:06,150
and it's just like someone's mouth.
就像被别人嘴顶着

590
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:10,500
And then I said, "I don't really think I'm ready to be kissing.
我跟他说 “我还没准备好亲...

591
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,550
I just got out of a thing."
我刚结束一段恋情”

592
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,910
Which is something I made up.
这是当时瞎编的

593
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:17,230
It's okay to lie about that.
找个借口是对的

594
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,840
And then he said, "That's okay."
他回了句 “没事”

595
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:24,520
"We can just sit on the couch and watch a movie."
“在沙发上一起看个电影吧”

596
00:37:24,690 --> 00:37:27,110
So he started playing something.
他播了个片子

597
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:30,430
It was animated, which I thought was weird.
是动画片 起初觉得怪怪的

598
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,040
But then I remembered he has a kid,
但一想他还有个孩子

599
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:35,070
so that made it less weird.
就不那么怪了

600
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:40,150
Then he started putting his hand on my pants,
然后他把手伸到我裤裆上

601
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,650
and I was kinda moving it away.
我想推开

602
00:37:45,770 --> 00:37:48,300
But he kept moving it back to my pants,
他老是伸回来

603
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:51,180
and then he started putting his hand down my pants, like,
最后直接把手伸到我裤子里

604
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,480
in between the pants and my underwear.
就隔着层内裤

605
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:58,710
And I was kinda squirming my body like...
我不断扭身挣扎

606
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,450
he was...
他的...

607
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:08,560
his fingers were really strong and hard, like, in the bad way.
他的手指粗暴使劲

608
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,870
Like, it was too hard.
太用力了

609
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:16,190
Maybe it would've felt good if I wanted his fingers to be doing that.
要是我同意 可能会享受

610
00:38:16,270 --> 00:38:17,400
But you didn't want that.
但你不同意

611
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:19,390
No, I didn't.
不 根本不同意

612
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:26,520
And then, I pulled his hand out because...
然后我拽出他的手 因为...

613
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,220
it didn't feel good,
因为真不舒服

614
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,240
and it actually hurt, kinda.
甚至还疼

615
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,130
And then I started kissing him
然后我去吻他

616
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,030
because I thought,
我心想

617
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,910
"Well, if we have to be doing something,"
得做点什么

618
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:46,210
"I'd rather it be kissing than his fingers down there."
宁可接吻也不想被摸

619
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:52,880
And then I don't remember.
之后一片空白

620
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,750
And then at some point, his hand was back in my underwear.
突然间 他又把手伸进来了

621
00:39:04,770 --> 00:39:07,640
But under the underwear now.
但这次是内裤里面

622
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:10,550
And I was trying to move it away again.
我不断拽他的手

623
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,730
Sounds like you were trying to move it away a lot.
听上去你一直在想办法

624
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:14,500
Yeah. That's what I kept thinking.
嗯 一直在想

625
00:39:15,370 --> 00:39:17,890
Like, one more time and he won't move it back
心想 只要再制止他一次

626
00:39:17,910 --> 00:39:20,080
because it's so obvious I'm moving it away.
他就会明白

627
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,860
But he kept moving it back.
但他还不断地把手伸回来

628
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:27,920
And then...
然后...

629
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:32,200
he was pulling down my pants. well, he was trying to pull them down,
他开始脱我裤子 用力扯

630
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,540
but they have a button.
但没解扣子

631
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:38,000
So he was pulling, pulling.
他就一直扯啊扯

632
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:40,140
And I was pulling them back up.
我就往回拽

633
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:45,200
And then they were halfway down.
最后裤子被扯到大腿间

634
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:49,150
And I felt something go in, like, in me,
然后感觉有什么就 就进来了

635
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:53,080
and my spine got cold.
我毛骨悚然

636
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,690
And I reached down to feel it and...
我伸手去摸...

637
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,230
It was...
发现...

638
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:05,130
It was him... you know?
是他的...懂吧

639
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:11,280
And then I jumped up and...
然后我跳起来

640
00:40:11,310 --> 00:40:13,690
I sat on the side of the couch.
坐到沙发另一头

641
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:16,530
I don't know how long.
不知道发呆了多久

642
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:22,950
And I looked at his face once,
只敢瞥他一眼

643
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:26,650
and it was, like, scared.
他居然 害怕了

644
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:30,290
- His face was scared? - Yes.
- 他看起来害怕？ - 是

645
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,230
And then I just got up kinda slowly,
然后我慢慢起身

646
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:41,410
and I grabbed my boots,
拿上鞋

647
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,790
and I drove home,
开车回家

648
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:50,630
and now I'm here.
然后就在这儿了

649
00:40:57,150 --> 00:40:58,950
That sounds like...
你说的就是...

650
00:41:01,070 --> 00:41:02,520
that.
那种事

651
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,220
That is...
就是...

652
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,260
that's the thing.
那种事

653
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,970
I'm really, really sorry.
我真的 真的很心痛

654
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,100
I never know if I'm supposed to get fully naked.
这检查是不是得一丝不挂？

655
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:01,020
- Like in the gown? - Yeah.
- 只穿这病号服吗？ - 嗯

656
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:03,960
- Are you naked right now? - Yes.
- 你现在光着了吗？ - 是的

657
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:06,010
Dude, I don't think you're supposed to be naked.
小宝 你不该光着啊

658
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:08,260
Hi. You're Agnes?

So it's usually best to go to the emergency room
这种事最好...

676
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,170
right after something like this happens.
事发后马上来急诊

677
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:54,370
Oh, okay. I will definitely keep that in mind for the next time.
行 下回记住了

678
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:57,510
Well, that's when we would use a sexual assault forensic evidence kit.
在急诊室会用性侵取证包

679
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:00,450
Oh, okay. I feel like you just need to...tonally shift away from the tone
打断下 麻烦您换个说法

680
00:43:00,470 --> 00:43:02,310
you're taking right now.

Like, we just need a tonal shift.
温和点那种

682
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:09,460
Just wanna make sure he didn't give me anything, like, vaginally or yeah.

Did your attacker ejaculate in you?

Um, well, I wouldn't call him my attacker.
额 我不太想叫他施暴者

685
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,900

But you were raped.

689
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,250
It doesn't feel that you know that.
不像是您真理解了啊

690
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,970
These questions are protocol.
没办法 得按流程里的问

691
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,190
Yeah, you're asking them in a really freaky way.
嗯 但您问TA的方式真尖锐啊

692
00:43:30,210 --> 00:43:31,220
Calm down, ma'am.

699
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:51,210
So, we'll do a blood test to check you for pregnancy

00:56:11,300 --> 00:56:12,900
No, I'm not.

Here's your cat food.

856
00:56:26,110 --> 00:56:27,490

857
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,100
I got some.
我买了

858

you understand the meaning of beyond a reasonable doubt?
您明白“排除合理怀疑”意思吗？

880
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:37,550
{\an9}【译注 证据使陪审员对被告有罪的怀疑不再合理】

881
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:35,540
Yes.
明白

882
01:00:35,570 --> 01:00:37,610
That to be convinced beyond a shadow of a doubt,
要达到不怀疑的标准

883
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:40,440
you must have been there and seen the crime with your own eyes?
在案发时非得亲眼见到吗？

884
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,930
Yes. I understand.
不用 明白

885
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:43,300
And do the rest of you feel
大家都能以

886
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:47,670
- you can apply that idea, beyond a reasonable doubt, to this case? - Mhmm
- “排除合理怀疑”作为评判依据吗？ - 是

887
01:00:47,690 --> 01:00:50,310
How many of you have children?
有多少人是父母？

888
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,510
Uh, Mr. Woguard. You have a child?

Uh, yes. Soph just turned four.
嗯 是 索菲刚满四岁

890
01:00:56,340 --> 01:00:58,240
Say you and your daughter were at the park
假设您女儿在公园

891
01:00:58,260 --> 01:00:59,740
and she's playing on the monkey bars.
玩攀爬架

892
01:00:59,770 --> 01:01:01,660
And you turned your back for a few minutes,
您有几分钟没看她

893
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:04,620
and then she runs over to you with a broken arm.
她跑过来说胳膊伤了

894
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:06,030
What would you think happened?
您怎么判断？

895
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:08,330
She fell off the monkey bars and broke her arm.
她从攀爬架上掉下来摔的

896
01:01:08,350 --> 01:01:11,710
Yes, so that's an example of circumstantial evidence.
对 这就是间接证据的例子

897
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:15,530
That's what you can reasonably infer based on the facts that you have.
根据事实可以做出的合理推断

898
01:01:15,550 --> 01:01:17,600
Does this make sense, Mr. Woguard?
沃瓜德先生 能明白吗

899
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:18,740
Yes.
明白

900
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:21,450
And if instead another child ran over to you
要是有其他孩子跑来告诉您

901
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:24,870
and told you he saw her fall off the monkey bars,
说看见她怎么摔的

902
01:01:24,910 --> 01:01:28,810
that's direct testimony because someone witnessed it.
有人目击 这就是直接证词

903
01:01:28,830 --> 01:01:31,230
Does everybody understand that difference,
大家能明白

904
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:34,820
between circumstantial evidence and direct testimony?
间接证据和直接证词的区别吗？

905
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:36,190
Mhmm.
能

906
01:01:36,210 --> 01:01:37,650
Without direct testimony,
没有直接证词

907
01:01:37,670 --> 01:01:41,540
we cannot be positively certain a crime has been committed.
就不能肯定犯罪一定发生

908
01:01:41,570 --> 01:01:42,990
As the prosecution,
作为检方

909
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:46,650
I must prove the defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
我得把罪证明到排除合理怀疑

910
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:50,000
Meaning, that there is no other reasonable explanation
即 从现有的证据中

911
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:52,410
that can come from evidence presented.
不存在其他合理解释

912
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:54,960
If any of you have been victims of a crime,
谁是犯罪受害者

913
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:56,840
please raise your hand.
请举手

914
01:01:57,650 --> 01:02:00,390
Uh, Mr. Faber, what was the crime?
费伯先生 您遭遇了什么？

915
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:02,510
Uh, I was robbed. At gunpoint.
我被抢劫了 持枪的

916
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:03,180
Do you have any reason to believe
您认为

917
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:05,690
that experience would make you unable to serve
那次遭遇会妨碍您

918
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:08,210
as an impartial juror on this trial?
担任此庭公正陪审员吗？

919
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:09,410
No.
不会

920
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:12,450
Miss Ward.
沃德小姐

921
01:02:13,600 --> 01:02:14,430
What?
什么？

922
01:02:14,460 --> 01:02:16,480
When I asked who has been a victim of a crime,
刚问到受害者时

923
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:17,770
did you raise your hand?
您举手了吧？

924
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:21,780
No, I realized I shouldn't share it. So...
不是的 我不能讲这件事 就...

925
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,990
You're unable to share the crime?
不能讲受害经历？

926
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:30,690
It is frankly my worst nightmare to have to tell this whole room of strangers
这样说吧 大庭广众说出来那事儿

927
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:32,630
about the thing that happened to me.
是我最害怕的

928
01:02:32,660 --> 01:02:33,860
So...
所以...

929
01:02:33,890 --> 01:02:37,440
that is the reasoning as to why I did not decide
所以我才把手

930
01:02:37,470 --> 01:02:39,750
to continue having my hand raised.
又放下来了

931
01:02:39,770 --> 01:02:40,950
Thank you.
见谅

932
01:02:42,630 --> 01:02:45,630
Do you think the crime would make you unable to serve
那次遭遇会妨碍您

933
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:48,140
as an impartial juror on this case?
担任此庭公正陪审员吗？

934
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:52,520
That is a good question, and one I've been thinking about.
问得好 我一直在想这个

935
01:02:53,410 --> 01:02:55,690
Have you come to any conclusions?
想出结论了吗？

936
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:59,730
You know, I think I would be better not being on the jury
我觉得 退出陪审团更合适

937
01:02:59,750 --> 01:03:02,910
and instead would do better fulfilling a different civic role.
做别的事情为社会做贡献

938
01:03:02,940 --> 01:03:06,150
And what kind of civic role do you have in mind?
什么别的事情？

939
01:03:06,170 --> 01:03:10,350
So, thank you for asking. I am actually a professor,
谢谢你问 我是个教授

940
01:03:10,970 --> 01:03:13,870
part-time, hopefully soon full-time,
还没转正 期待早日实现

941
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:15,830
which, teaching is important work.
教书很重要

942
01:03:15,850 --> 01:03:18,060
I think teaching is important.
教学是很有意义的

943
01:03:18,090 --> 01:03:22,230
Some would say that a teacher makes an ideal juror.
有人说教师是最合适的陪审员

944
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:24,510
Absolutely not, no.
才不是呢 不

945
01:03:24,530 --> 01:03:26,340
On your questionnaire, you wrote...
你的问卷表上写着...

946
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:27,420
Oh, no, no.
哦 别 别

947
01:03:27,450 --> 01:03:30,320
I did not know that we would be reading those aloud, so.
我没想到会被当众念出来

948
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:32,240
"How would your friends describe you?"
“你朋友怎样形容你”

949
01:03:32,270 --> 01:03:35,980
"Smart." Crossed out, then the word "tall."
“聪明”被划掉了 改成了个“高”

950
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:43,360
If the crime you were a victim of makes you biased, we will dismiss you.
要是那遭遇让你有偏见 就会免除你

951
01:03:45,170 --> 01:03:46,740
Can I get in trouble for telling you?
说了不会惹上事吧？

952
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,090
Why would you get in trouble if you were the victim?
你是受害者 怎会有事？

953
01:03:49,120 --> 01:03:50,410
I don't know.
我不知道

954
01:03:50,430 --> 01:03:53,590
The law makes no sense in my opinion.
法律有很多不讲理的地方

955
01:03:58,430 --> 01:03:59,430
I...
那...

956
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:06,070
I haven't said it out loud actually before.
那事我从未公开说过

957
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:07,640
Well, that's okay.
没关系的

958
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:09,460
Did you go to the police?
你报警了吗？

959
01:04:10,410 --> 01:04:11,500
No.
没有

960
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:14,270
All I had was a button,
物证只有个扣子

961
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:17,080
and I don't want him to go to jail.
我也不想见他坐牢

962
01:04:17,410 --> 01:04:18,870
Why is that?
为什么？

963
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,080
He has a kid.
他有个孩子

964
01:04:28,540 --> 01:04:32,330
I want him to stop being someone who does that.
我希望给他个机会改过

965
01:04:33,140 --> 01:04:34,470
And if he went to jail,
要是进了监狱

966
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:38,880
he'd just be someone who does that, who's now in jail.
他就永远被定义成那种人了

967
01:04:44,950 --> 01:04:48,340
Your honor, may I approach the bench?
法官阁下 我可以上前吗？

01:04:55,010 --> 01:04:58,140
Agnes Ward, you are excused.

01:05:23,150 --> 01:05:24,230
Oh, my God.

977
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:14,950

1138
01:15:50,770 --> 01:15:55,010
I gotta be honest, I don't really breathe like that, but it feels good.
真心说 我平时不这么呼吸 但感觉不错

1139
01:15:55,070 --> 01:15:56,540
You doing okay?
还好吧？

1140
01:15:57,080 --> 01:15:58,330
Good for you.
干得好

1141
01:15:59,780 --> 01:16:02,090
You want a sandwich?
想吃个三明治吗？

1142
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:12,950
I wanted to put tables out here, so,
我本想摆这儿几张桌子

1143
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:15,300
people, you know, wouldn't sit on the ground.
至少有地方坐着吃

1144
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,620
It's a good sandwich.
这三明治配得上好地方

1145
01:16:18,650 --> 01:16:19,860
You shouldn't eat a good sandwich
不该坐在

1146
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:22,440
while you're sitting on the ground where the pigeons shit.
都是鸟屎的地上吃

1147
01:16:22,570 --> 01:16:23,650
Whatever.
算了

1148
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:27,730
But they said, you share a...a parking lot with the guys at the dump.
他们说 这停车场和垃圾场共用

1149
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,760
So you gotta ask the guys at the dump.
得那帮人同意

1150
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:32,700
No fucking way I'm asking the guys at the dump!
我才不找你们那帮垃圾！

1151
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:33,770
Fuck you.
你才垃圾呢

1152
01:16:35,620 --> 01:16:36,990
Fucking assholes.
一帮垃圾

1153
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,140
This is good.
真好吃

1154
01:16:40,280 --> 01:16:42,270
Yeah, of course it's good.
嗯 当然好

1155
01:16:43,240 --> 01:16:47,100
You don't have a sandwich shop, you don't make a good sandwich.
没有金刚钻哪敢开个店

1156
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:48,560
Spicy.
辣辣的

1157
01:16:48,580 --> 01:16:51,500
Yeah, calabrian chili, very expensive.
意大利进口辣椒 挺贵的

1158
01:16:53,220 --> 01:16:54,610
Agnes.
安尼丝

1159
01:16:55,330 --> 01:16:56,330
Huh?

1160
01:16:56,970 --> 01:16:59,320
- Agnes? - Yeah.
- 叫“安你死”？ - 对

1161
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:01,390
Ugh.
难听

1162
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:04,560
Whoa, you sound like the mean guys from the dump.
哎呦 你和那帮人一样坏啊

1163
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:07,600
Hey! I res... I resent that.
喂 我不同意

1164
01:17:07,620 --> 01:17:12,030
Those guys are assholes. I'm honest, not an asshole.
那帮人才是垃圾 我说话直 心不坏

1165
01:17:12,990 --> 01:17:14,370
You have a son?
你有个儿子？

1166
01:17:14,900 --> 01:17:16,190
He's an asshole.
他也是垃圾

1167
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:18,280
Hank.

1168
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,990
- Hank is... - Ugh...
- 汉克嘛... - 难听

1169
01:17:22,070 --> 01:17:23,970
You don't have to tell me.
不用跟我解释

1170
01:17:23,990 --> 01:17:26,500
Sounds too much like the word honk.
听起来像“憨克”

1171
01:17:26,970 --> 01:17:29,490
- You have kids? - No.
- 你有孩子吗？ - 绝不

1172
01:17:31,220 --> 01:17:32,640
Want some?
不想要吗？

1173
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:37,410
Uh... Well, I can't really imagine myself old.
啊 我想象不到自己老了啥样

1174
01:17:37,430 --> 01:17:39,850
You think I imagined myself like this?
你以为我料到变成这样？

1175
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:42,740
No, believe it or not,
不 说实话

1176
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:47,720
I did not think I would end up looking like a yam with a mouth on it.
真没料到自己变成有嘴的山药

1177
01:17:48,390 --> 01:17:49,940
But here we are.
现实就这样

1178
01:17:50,890 --> 01:17:53,110
It'll happen to you.
该来的总会来

1179
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:55,780
You won't know what hit you.
你根本料不到

1180
01:18:00,560 --> 01:18:02,830
Something pretty bad happened to me,
我就碰上一桩噩事

1181
01:18:02,860 --> 01:18:05,680
so that's probably why I'm acting weird.
因此才有点不正常呢

1182
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:08,340
How bad?
有多糟？

1183
01:18:10,370 --> 01:18:12,320
I guess really bad.
算很糟吧

1184
01:18:13,120 --> 01:18:15,910
You don't know it's bad?
你自己不觉得糟吗？

1185
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:20,150
No, I know it's bad.
不 我知道那很糟

1186
01:18:21,470 --> 01:18:24,780
But mainly because whenever I tell anyone about it,
只是每次跟人提

1187
01:18:25,160 --> 01:18:27,800
they look really scared for me.
他们都大惊小怪

1188
01:18:27,820 --> 01:18:31,400
Except for my friend, but she moved away.
除了我那朋友 但她搬走了

1189
01:18:31,900 --> 01:18:34,840
And then sometimes I feel bad when I think about it,
我一回想就难受

1190
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:36,740
because...
有时...

1191
01:18:37,730 --> 01:18:40,570
I remember moments of it,
会浮现一些瞬间

1192
01:18:41,000 --> 01:18:45,180
and I can feel in my body
然后身体会有强烈的

1193
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:48,370
that it was really bad.
排斥反应

1194
01:18:50,240 --> 01:18:53,370
But then sometimes I don't think about it, which is weird.
有时我完全不去想 挺怪的

1195
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:59,610
And I feel guilty when I don't think about it.
不想就内疚 像背叛那段痛

1196
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:01,980
Did it just happen?
刚发生的吗？

1197
01:19:02,000 --> 01:19:04,200
Is that why you were huffing and puffing?
所以你才喘成那样？

1198
01:19:04,250 --> 01:19:07,040
No, it was three...
不 是三年...

1199
01:19:07,070 --> 01:19:09,810
a little over three years ago.
是三年多前了

1200
01:19:09,930 --> 01:19:11,870
Well, that's not that much time.
好吧 不算太久

1201
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:16,840
I mean, it's a lot of time, but it's not that much time, too.
严格说 也不短了 但也不太长

1202
01:19:18,230 --> 01:19:19,530
Yeah.
是啊

1203
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:24,690
Are you...
你...

1204
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:28,810
okay in your house?
家里有人陪你吗？

1205
01:19:30,050 --> 01:19:31,560
I have a cat.
我有只猫

1206
01:19:32,330 --> 01:19:33,460
Okay.

1207
01:19:49,300 --> 01:19:52,050

1208
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:54,910
Olga, go to bed.

1210
01:20:02,030 --> 01:20:03,040

1212
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,610
Oh, my God.
天呐

1213
01:20:08,700 --> 01:20:11,980
Oh, if you wanted to kill it, you should have just killed it!
想杀就别留它口气啊

1214
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:14,930
Okay. I'm coming back. I'm coming back.

Like, in my head.

01:34:44,780 --> 01:34:49,670
Like, if you have a thought and you're like, that's a bad thought,
都可以告诉我 哪怕是个坏念头

1413
01:34:50,830 --> 01:34:55,250
I probably had that same thought but, like, ten times worse.
我很可能也有过 而且更坏

1414
01:34:57,170 --> 01:34:59,550
So you can just tell me.

1415
01:35:00,200 --> 01:35:03,280
I'll never be scared by that.

If someone does something bad to you...

1417
01:35:11,160 --> 01:35:16,100
If someone says something scary...
有人借此闲言碎语 冷嘲热讽...

1418
01:35:16,120 --> 01:35:21,710
If you wanna kill yourself with like a pencil or a knife or whatever,

you can just tell me.

I'll just say, yeah. I know.

It's just like that sometimes.

1423
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:41,910

that bad things are gonna happen to you.

1426
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:54,930
I hope they don't.
希望不会

1427
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:58,720
If I can ever stop something from being bad, let me know.
要是我能阻止 一定要跟我说

1428
01:36:01,380 --> 01:36:04,870
But sometimes bad stuff just happens.
坏事不会给你打招呼

1429
01:36:07,430 --> 01:36:09,980
That's why I feel bad for you,
所以我有点心疼你

1430
01:36:10,010 --> 01:36:11,260
in a way.
某种程度上

1431
01:36:13,030 --> 01:36:19,300
That you're alive and you don't know that yet.
你活着却还体会不到

1432
01:36:25,760 --> 01:36:29,120
But I can still listen

1433
01:36:29,140 --> 01:36:31,330
and not be scared.
不会大惊小怪

1434
01:36:35,610 --> 01:36:37,230
So that's good.
这很好

1435
01:36:38,980 --> 01:36:42,050
Or that's something, at least.
至少是点儿安慰

1436
